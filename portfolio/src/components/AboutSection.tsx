                    ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm a computer science major at Georgia Tech. I don't label 
                    myself as a "full-stack developer", a "graphics engine programmer", 
                    or a "networking engineer". I believe that the skills I obtained at Georgia Tech 
                    have given me the ability to adapt to anything technical. And I believe that the computer 
                    science degree I'm pursuing helps me think as a <strong><em>computer scientist</em></strong>, and hence
                    I always like to think of myself as one. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="pl-5 pr-5 text-base md:text-xl">
                    That being said, I do have particular interest in specific fields within computer science.
                    These include, and are not limited to,  computer systems, computer networking, algorithms, machine learning, computer graphics,
                    and combinatorics. I have experience in these fields thanks to the opportunity I have studying at Georgia Tech, and also through
                    personal projects and internships.
                </p>

                    When I'm not coding, I do even MORE coding in competitive programming (I'm half joking ðŸ˜…).
                    I also like to hang out with my friends and fraternity, train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, lift weights, and 
                    camo grind on COD.
